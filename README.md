The Etch-a-Sketch Project
In this application, users are able to draw freely, using any color, on the board after choosing the grid count.
Just pick the number of grids, click run, and hover the mouse cursor over the board. 
Also, it has the "rainbow" option which randomly changes color for each grid box.

This is my take on the third project assignment found on the Odin Project's Foundation course.

This application was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
